## Cryptocurrencies price analysis

This repository contains notebooks used to analyse prices flactuations for different cryptocurrencies over time.

The goal was to identify patterns and exploit them to plan an investment strategy accordingly.

We tried to answer questions such as:

**Question**

Has it been more profitable to to implement a weekly DCA (Dollar Cost Avaraging) investment over a monthly one for a specific coin?

**Answer**

We observed that the monthly DAC has provided both the highest and lowest profits. We therefore conclude that the best approach for those aiming at maximising the profit should use a monthly approach. As long as the right day in the month is picked to invest, since the risk is to lower the profit if the wrong day is picked. A following analysis will try to identify the best day of month to invest for a specific coin.
For a more stable profit, biweekly seems to provide more constant profits, regardless of the days on which the investment is made.

**Question**

In case of a monthly DAC, what was the day of the month that historically provided the most profit?

**Answer**

One question we addressed was to identify the most profitable day of the month for a monthly DCA strategy on a specific portolio of currencies.

It turned out that for a portfolio with 40% [BTC](https://bitcoin.org/da/), 40% [ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/) and 20% [ADA](https://cardano.org/) the day of month providing the highest profit was the 16th.
